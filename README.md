# baby-name

Swipe together and find a baby name you both like!

Currently deployed at https://bby.vercel.app.

I'm using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework (with
Typescript), and [Pico CSS](https://v2.picocss.com/docs) +
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styles.
Icons are from [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) &
[Tabler](https://tabler.io/icons) and the font is
[Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik),
from Google Fonts.

If you want to run the app locally, clone the repo and run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
